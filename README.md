# SimCopterRandomizer
Replaces the tweak files with randomized values. Includes a reset option to return everything back to default values.

Place the executable in the SIMCOPTER\tweak folder, and then use the buttons to choose which aspects of the game to randomize.

Career randomizes the settings of every city when playing a Career Game. These settings include the difficulty and frequency of missions, how many points you require to finish a city, and how much money you receive when completing the city.

Missions randomizes the settings of missions in every game mode. These settings include money and point rewards for completing missions; including catching speeders and shooting down UFOs, point and money penalties for failing missions, and timers for some of the time sensitive missions.

Helicopters randomizes the settings of helicopters in every game mode. The helicopter specific settings include movement speeds, purchase price, repair and refuel costs, how much damage the helicopter can take, and how much fuel the helicopter can hold. Settings that affect all helicopters include acceptable landing conditions, descent speed, rescue harness and bambi bucket rope physics, bambi bucket fill and empty speed, water cannon distance and recoil force, height ranges which fire does damage, helicopter value depreciation, and distance maintenance cost multipliers.

Fire randomizes the remaining aspects of fires. These settings include dousing progress rewards, life time of fires, speed and likelihood of fires spreading, and general size of individual fires.

AutoMissions randomizes Fire Scan and Road Scan values. What these do is currently unknown, and if you have any insights, please let me know so that this document may be updated.

Customized mode allows for customization of each individual item in each tweak file within the ranges originally defined in the files. Any items which are checked off will be skipped and remain unchanged.

The optional seed value can be any string. If you want a random seed, leave the box blank.
